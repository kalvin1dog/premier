Hi Matthew,

I have rolled a new version of the prototype.
https://flash.elanorinvestors.com/PREMIER/

I have tried to do step 6, below, of
  where you select an order to be based off (includes vehicle number and date)

6.       To create a new Kitchen Order the “Sales Staff” would be presented with a screen that will need them to choose the following:
    a.       The vehicle number that the order data is to be based off.
    b.       The Vehicle number that the submitted order is to be submitted for.
    c.       The date that the order form will use sales data from for the purpose of generating the base order.
    d.       The date that the submitted order is to be submitted to the system as being for.

Please note, that I have used a test Sales Staff person (ie John Brown) who has logged on,
by default.

I have entered 7 Sales Orders, for only John Brown, and he is linked to the different Vehicles on
the same date. This would not happen in the real system, as I will check that a sales staff have only
one vehicle for the day.

This is a TEST application, as I need to link my database with all the Sales Staff login details in your
central database.

Anyway, check out the prototype, and see if OK.

I have attached an Invoice for my the last 10 days.


Regards
Kalvin
